This mockup is created with the help of Smart Objects. In order to edit the file, you need to place your graphics in Smart Layers from the "Edit Content" folder (they're marked with green). If you're a Photoshop pro, customize the scene the way you want: the files are well-organized, which makes it convenient and clear to work with them.
